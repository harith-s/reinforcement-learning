# Reinforcement Learning Assignments

This repository contains two assignments for a reinforcement learning course. The first assignment focuses on working with multi-armed bandits, while the second involves a 4x4 grid with reward pots where you will apply a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the optimal policy.

## Description

### Assignment 1: Multi-Armed Bandits
In this assignment, you will work with multi-armed bandits. You can adjust the exploration value \( \epsilon \) to see how it affects the performance of the algorithm.

### Assignment 2: Markov Decision Process
In this assignment, you will work with a 4x4 grid containing reward pots. The goal is to apply a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to figure out the optimal policy. You can change the positions and values of the reward pots to see how the optimal policy changes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git

2. Make sure necessary libraries such as numpy, pygame and matplotlib are installed.
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib pygame
```
3. Run with the IDLE of your choice.

## Usage
### Assignment 1: Multi-Armed Bandits
```sh
   python assignment1.py
```
The value of epsilon can be changed within the code under the main function.

## Assignment 2: Markov Decision Process
```sh
   python assignment2.py
```
The reward pots can be changed by altering the reward array in the beginning of the file.
