# Reinforcement Learning Assignments

This repository contains two assignments for a reinforcement learning course. The first assignment focuses on working with multi-armed bandits, while the second involves a 4x4 grid with reward pots where you will apply a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the optimal policy.

## Description

### Assignment 1: Multi-Armed Bandits
In this assignment, you will work with multi-armed bandits. You can adjust the exploration value \( \epsilon \) to see how it affects the performance of the algorithm.

### Assignment 2: Markov Decision Process
In this assignment, you will work with a 4x4 grid containing reward pots. The goal is to apply a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to figure out the optimal policy. You can change the positions and values of the reward pots to see how the optimal policy changes.
